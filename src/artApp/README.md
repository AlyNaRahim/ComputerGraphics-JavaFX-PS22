<h2> Creating Static Art with a Canvas Node </h2>

<h3> Description </h3>

Create an art app similar to the Painter app in Section 13.3 that allows you to draw shapes by clicking and dragging the mouse in a Canvas. Include options for:
<ol> <li> Selecting the shape to drawâ€”line, rectangle, or oval.
<li> Changing the line color and line thickness.
<li> Specifying the fill color for rectangles and ovals.
<li> Provide red, green, and blue sliders that allow you to select the RGBA color for the line or fill. 
<li> Include a color swatch below the three sliders so that as you move each slider, the color swatch shows you the current drawing color. 
<li> Also include options that allows you to turn the cursor into an eraser and to clear the entire drawing. </ol>
